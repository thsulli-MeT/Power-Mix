Power Mix-Beta
HOW TO USE YOUR OWN TRACKS
Shift+Click on the Sample or Track Load button and locate the .wav or .mp3 from your machine.

BASIC DJ STRATEGIES
1) Power Transitions (why they exist)
No beatmatch yet — the Power Mix Transitions are built to make swaps feel musical without BPM matching. Try them when both decks are playing.

2) Timeline Jump (the secret weapon)
Click the waveform to instantly jump to any moment. Use it to skip intros, jump to a drop, or recover fast if you miss a cue.

3) Hot Spots as “moment samples” (your discovery)
Set Hot Spots on a hit/word/drum fill. Jump to it live like a sample, then release back into the track when you’re done.

4) Chase Mix (same track, two decks)
Load the same track on A and B. Use crossfader + Hot Spots to bounce between them for motion, stutters, and call/response.

5) Echo/Space Fade (smooth exits)
Tap ECHO or SPACE on the outgoing deck, then fade it down/cross out. It leaves a tail so the cut doesn’t feel harsh.

6) “Cut Drop” — line up B at a strong moment, then CUT on the beat.
